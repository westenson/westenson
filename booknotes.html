                                            Ada Lovelace - gifted at mathematics and considered the first computer
                                            programmer. Worked with Charles Babbage on Babbage's Difference Engine, a
                                            mechanical machine that could calculate polynomial functions. Lovelace later
                                            proposed the Analytical Engine, an improved version of the Difference
                                            Engine. Died in 1852.

                                            <br><br>
                                            AT&T's Bell Labs was the "idea factory" during and after WWII where hundreds
                                            of scientists and engineers were given a relatively free hand to explore and
                                            improvise. Important names here are John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and
                                            William Shockley; they created the transistor, the fundamental building
                                            block of the microprocessor.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Not long after, Gordon Moore predicted the doubling of a microprocessor's
                                            power every year and a half, now known as Moore's Law which has been
                                            incredibly accurate

                                            <br><br>
                                            Universities and the U.S. military created the network ARPANET in 1969 which
                                            was opened to more companies in 1973.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Another innovation hotspot was Xerox PARC in the 1970s with innovations
                                            including ethernet, the graphic user interface and the mouse. A popular
                                            phrase at the park was "the best way to predict the future is to invent it."

                                            <br><br>
                                            Bill Gates was a computer maniac, lucky to have grown up with access to one.
                                            Microsoft was founded with the foresight that hardware would soon become
                                            commodified (with low profits) and software would rule the world. We know
                                            how that bet turned out.

                                            <br><br>
                                            The beginnings of the personal computer can be traced back to the Homebrew
                                            Computer Club. Who was in the club? None other than Steve Jobs and Steve
                                            Wozniak. Jobs was a visionary with an acute sense for aesthetic and user
                                            interaction.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Overarching themes:
                                            The internet and computer were built through an incremental and continuous
                                            effort of people from different backgrounds and different skills. Although
                                            "open-source" was not a term at the time, this is how the internet and
                                            computer were created and we wouldn't have it today if it wasn't for
                                            people's
                                            willingness to share their discoveries for all to benefit and push the
                                            industry forward.

                                            This book is a series of mini biographies for a reason. It took many people
                                            to create the Digital Revolution. Isaacson attributes a powerful role in
                                            this revolution to ecosystems. Silicon Valley includes venture capital,
                                            strong universities churning out smart computer scientists and engineers and
                                            even significant government funding. All these came together to provide the
                                            perfect environment for innovation.

                                            Outliers are people who do not fit our conventional understanding of
                                            achievement

                                            <br><br>
                                            High IQ does not increase your chances of success by much. What matters the
                                            most is practical intelligence (ie. knowing what to say to whom, when, and
                                            how). This became clear through a research study does by Professor Lewis
                                            Madison Terman who conducted a longitudinal study of 1,500 with IQs of 150+.
                                            There was almost no correlation between success and IQ found in the
                                            experiment. "Anything above an IQ of 120 points has no significant impact on
                                            the attainment of success".

                                            <br><br>
                                            "Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to
                                            work hard for 22 minutes when most people would give up after 30 seconds".

                                            <br><br>
                                            Success has a degree of opportunity and is not solely based on hard work.
                                            Success relies on opportunities, circumstances, and hidden advantages as
                                            well.
                                            It makes a difference where and when you grow up.

                                            <br><br>
                                            When you are deliberate about tapping into opportunities (creating and
                                            pursing), you have a much higher chance of mastery and success

                                            <br><br>
                                            With commitment, anyone can become an outlier. Think 10,000 hours here.
                                            Something that all successful people examined had was an intense commitment
                                            to their craft. Deep work with feedback required.

                                            List America's richest people in history, 14/75 were born in the 1860s and
                                            '70s. This was the industrial revolution taking off. The same thing happened
                                            in Silicon Valley; all the top early tech entrepreneurs were born between
                                            1953 and 1956. Those born in 1935, there were 600,000 fewer babies born that
                                            year which meant smaller class sizes, better chance to get on good sports
                                            teams and colleges, and, thus, better chances of getting great jobs.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Works the other way as well. If you were born in the 1890s to early 1900,
                                            these people face the Spanish Flu, WWI, the Great Depression, and were still
                                            young enough to be drafted in WWII (if they hadn't been killed already!).

                                            Our values are unconsciously handed down to us from generation to
                                            generation. When analyzing different country's cultural tendencies, we find
                                            stark differences. Psychologist, Geert Hofstede, identified several
                                            different dimensions. These include Individualism vs Collectivism (ie. how
                                            much we expect you to look after yourself vs the group), Uncertainty
                                            Avoidance (ie how well one tolerates ambiguity), and Power-Distance Index
                                            (ie attitudes towards hierarchy).


                                            <br><br>
                                            Overarching themes:
                                            When opportunity presents itself, seize it. Its often quite arbitrary (ie.
                                            birthdates, right place right time), but you can increase your chances of it
                                            arising.

                                            Timing is critical to success and opporuntity

                                            There is no short cut to mastery than putting in the hours, 10,000 if you
                                            want a number. (meaningful, deliberate work is required)
