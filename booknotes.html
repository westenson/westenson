                                            Setting during and after WWI from 1940s to 1960s

                                            <br><br>
                                            Main character is Billy Pilgrim, odd dude who was always out of place
                                            growing up. Does well in school and enrolls in the Ilium School of
                                            Optometry. Drafted into army during WWII. His job is to be a chaplain's
                                            assistant.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Billy is captured by the Germans and put in a POW camp. At this point, he
                                            has his first incident of "time-shifting". He sees his entire life. The camp
                                            that Billy joins is filled with English officers who were captured earlier
                                            in the war. They have developed a relationship of mutual respect with their
                                            German guards. Thus, their POW camp is quite posh.

                                            <br><br>
                                            All while the story of Billy's war experience is told, we get moments of
                                            "time-shifting" where Billy gets catapulted to different points in his life.

                                            <br><br>
                                            After some days at the camp, Billy and the other Americans travel on to the
                                            city of Dresden, untouched from the war. Here they begin forced labor in a
                                            nutritional malt syrup factory, formerly a slaughterhouse for pigs.

                                            <br><br>
                                            One night, the city is bombarded by the Allied Forces, killing roughly
                                            130,000 people. Bill and the Americans survive in the bunker of the
                                            slaughterhouse. Several days later the war ends and Billy heads back home.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Billy finishes optometry school and gets engaged to the daughter of the
                                            Dean. However, Billy has a breakdown and goes to the veterans hospital where
                                            he meets a fellow patient who introduces him to the science fiction author
                                            Kilgore Trout. After Billy leaves the hospital, he gets married and his
                                            father-in-law sets him up with his own optometry practice.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Years later, Billy explains to his daughter that he was kidnapped by aliens
                                            called Tralfamadorians. They took him to their planet, Tralfamadore, where
                                            they keep him in a zoo and have him mate with an abducted movie actress,
                                            Montana Wildhack.

                                            <br><br>
                                            “If I hadn’t spent so much time studying Earthlings,” said the
                                            Tralfamadorian, “I wouldn’t have any idea what was meant by ‘free will.’
                                            I’ve visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have
                                            studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free
                                            will.”

                                            <br><br>
                                            The Tralfamdorians explain that the see the universe in 4 dimensions,
                                            including time. They see the past, present, and future as one. Every part of
                                            a persons life is just an event at a particular time, so death is not so
                                            important; somewhere else, they are alive and well.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Back on earth, Billy gets on a chartered plain for an optometry conference.
                                            He knows that the plane will crash, but says nothing. After the crash, Billy
                                            undergoes brain surgery. His wife dies in a car accident on the way to see
                                            him. His daughter thinks he's crazy. Billy predicts his death with a tape
                                            recording and adds that he will only skip back to some other point in his
                                            life upon his killing.

                                            <br><br>
                                            At the beginning of the book, Vonnegut writes that the novel will end with
                                            the phrase "Poo-tee-weet." At the end of the war, the world is quiet, as it
                                            always is after a massacre. That is, except for birds. "Poo-tee-weet" is the
                                            only thing that is said after massacre, because no one can justify them.
                                            This is an antiwar book, clearly it shows here.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Throughout the book, the phrase "so it goes" appears after every mention of
                                            death. Billy learns this from the Tralfamadorians with the idea that a
                                            person is only dead in one particular moment. I imagine Vonnegut is
                                            symbolizing the desensitization of death during war.


                                            <br><br>
                                            Overarching themes:
                                            Vonnegut inserts himself in the story throughout the book, showing us that
                                            he too was a POW in Dresden. His main theme is the destructiveness of war
                                            and the lack of justification for so many deaths. The story of Billy Pilgrim
                                            shows how life is disrupted long after the war is over. The Tralfmadorian
                                            theory of the 4th dimension is the only way Billy can justify the
                                            destructiveness of war, an idea that is clearly far from reality.

                                            <br><br>
                                            There is also some overarching theme of free will. The Tralfamdorians theory
                                            of the 4th dimension make it obvious. all moments of life are occurring
                                            simultaneously so everything in life is determined. Billy is a weak solider
                                            without a gun, yet he survives and many great soldiers do not. Billy's
                                            effort do not carve his path in life, it is made for him.

                                            Death will come. "So it goes".

                                            Ada Lovelace - gifted at mathematics and considered the first computer
                                            programmer. Worked with Charles Babbage on Babbage's Difference Engine, a
                                            mechanical machine that could calculate polynomial functions. Lovelace later
                                            proposed the Analytical Engine, an improved version of the Difference
                                            Engine. Died in 1852.

                                            AT&T's Bell Labs was the "idea factory" during and after WWII where hundreds
                                            of scientists and engineers were given a relatively free hand to explore and
                                            improvise. Important names here are John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and
                                            William Shockley; they created the transistor, the fundamental building
                                            block of the microprocessor.

                                            <br><br>
                                            Not long after, Gordon Moore predicted the doubling of a microprocessor's
                                            power every year and a half, now known as Moore's Law which has been
                                            incredibly accurate

                                            Universities and the U.S. military created the network ARPANET in 1969 which
                                            was opened to more companies in 1973.

                                            Another innovation hotspot was Xerox PARC in the 1970s with innovations
                                            including ethernet, the graphic user interface and the mouse. A popular
                                            phrase at the park was "the best way to predict the future is to invent it."

                                            Bill Gates was a computer maniac, lucky to have grown up with access to one.
                                            Microsoft was founded with the foresight that hardware would soon become
                                            commodified (with low profits) and software would rule the world. We know
                                            how that bet turned out.

                                            The beginnings of the personal computer can be traced back to the Homebrew
                                            Computer Club. Who was in the club? None other than Steve Jobs and Steve
                                            Wozniak. Jobs was a visionary with an acute sense for aesthetic and user
                                            interaction.

                                            The internet and computer were built through an incremental and continuous
                                            effort of people from different backgrounds and different skills. Although
                                            "open-source" was not a term at the time, this is how the internet and
                                            computer were created and we wouldn't have it today if it wasn't for

                                            willingness to share their discoveries for all to benefit and push the
                                            industry forward.

                                            This book is a series of mini biographies for a reason. It took many people
                                            to create the Digital Revolution. Isaacson attributes a powerful role in
                                            this revolution to ecosystems. Silicon Valley includes venture capital,
                                            strong universities churning out smart computer scientists and engineers and
                                            even significant government funding. All these came together to provide the
                                            perfect environment for innovation.

                                            Outliers are people who do not fit our conventional understanding of
                                            achievement

                                            <br><br>
                                            High IQ does not increase your chances of success by much. What matters the
                                            most is practical intelligence (ie. knowing what to say to whom, when, and
                                            how). This became clear through a research study does by Professor Lewis
                                            Madison Terman who conducted a longitudinal study of 1,500 with IQs of 150+.
                                            There was almost no correlation between success and IQ found in the
                                            experiment. "Anything above an IQ of 120 points has no significant impact on
                                            the attainment of success".

                                            <br><br>
                                            "Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to
                                            work hard for 22 minutes when most people would give up after 30 seconds".

                                            <br><br>
                                            Success has a degree of opportunity and is not solely based on hard work.
                                            Success relies on opportunities, circumstances, and hidden advantages as
                                            well.
                                            It makes a difference where and when you grow up.

                                            <br><br>
                                            When you are deliberate about tapping into opportunities (creating and
                                            pursing), you have a much higher chance of mastery and success

                                            With commitment, anyone can become an outlier. Think 10,000 hours here.
                                            Something that all successful people examined had was an intense commitment
                                            to their craft. Deep work with feedback required.

                                            in Silicon Valley; all the top early tech entrepreneurs were born between

                                            year which meant smaller class sizes, better chance to get on good sports
                                            teams and colleges, and, thus, better chances of getting great jobs.

                                            Works the other way as well. If you were born in the 1890s to early 1900,
                                            these people face the Spanish Flu, WWI, the Great Depression, and were still
                                            young enough to be drafted in WWII (if they hadn't been killed already!).

                                            Our values are unconsciously handed down to us from generation to
                                            generation. When analyzing different country's cultural tendencies, we find
                                            stark differences. Psychologist, Geert Hofstede, identified several
                                            different dimensions. These include Individualism vs Collectivism (ie. how
                                            much we expect you to look after yourself vs the group), Uncertainty
                                            Avoidance (ie how well one tolerates ambiguity), and Power-Distance Index
                                            (ie attitudes towards hierarchy).

                                            Overarching themes:
                                            When opportunity presents itself, seize it. Its often quite arbitrary (ie.
                                            birthdates, right place right time), but you can increase your chances of it
                                            arising.
