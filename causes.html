                <h4 class="text-center">climate change</h4>
                <p> Climate change is, arguably, the most important long-term problem that humanity currently
                    faces. It will come with many complex problems that, if nothing else, will take major efforts to
                    adapt to. However, humanity has the opportunity to mitigate these impacts and come together in
                    the face of adversity. Major strides are being made across the globe in forms of climate research,
                    international pledges, and innovations for a sustainable future. These achievements are a
                    beginning, but the world must work together as we face these challenges through international
                    governmental unification, business incentive alignment, and strong cultural optimism in this
                    fight.

                <h4 class="text-center">wealth inequality</h4>
                <p> Capitalism is a beautiful thing. It has allowed the U.S. to become the richest and most
                    innovative nation in the world.
                    History shows that it has clearly been the most effective motivator of people and driver of higher
                    living standards. However, we have
                    veered from the course. Capitalism in the U.S. has stopped serving the majority of the population.
                    Technological innovation has vastly
                    improved the quality of our lives; but, in an increasingly globalized world, the economic benefits
                    go to only a few. I enjoy the analogy
                    of thinking about the economy as a pie. Capitalism is excellent at increasing the size of the pie,
                    but very poor at splitting it evenly.
                    A bright future for America is one that still rewards individuals for hard work and innovation but
                    splits the pie more evenly, instead of
                    giving 70% to just 10% of the population. I strongly believe that solving this problem would resolve
                    many of our
                    other issues.

                    one of the most important aspects of an indivudal's life, and it is talked about
                    far too little. My thoughts on this section are less developed; although there are
                    a plethora of online resources to educate yourself and improve your mental
                    wellbeing. Life is a beautiful thing. Take care of yourself.

                <h4 class="text-center">our education system</h4>
                <p> Today, the U.S. ranks 37th in maths, 18th in science and 13th in reading compared
                    to about 80 other nations. Further, about
                    64 percent of doctoral candidates and 68 percent in master’s programs
                    in 2016 were international students. The U.S. is following a clear downward trend
                    in the quality of our early education system relative to the rest of the world. Not only that, but
                    education is one of
                    the clear known equalizers in our unequal world; to level the playing field, we must
                    innovate in primary education. Further, we must reform our
                    age old system if we want to stay competitve with a thoughtful and intelligent population.
